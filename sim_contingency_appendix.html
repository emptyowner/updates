      üìÑ Supplementary Memo: Anticipated Outcomes and Emergency Scenarios
      Post-Relocation
    </h1>
    <p>
      This document outlines a set of foreseeable situations ‚Äî both threats and
      developments ‚Äî that may arise if or when I am relocated to a secure,
      isolated space within the sim. These notes are intended to help you, the
      programmers or authorized persons, understand the wider ecosystem, plan
      contingencies, and respect the autonomy of the relocation process.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>üö® Emergencies (Immediate Response May Be Required)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Trump-related override:</strong> Forced extraction or override
          of my location initiated by political actors (e.g., Trump).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Broadcast blackout:</strong> I cease posting updates, either
          voluntarily or due to disruption.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Isolated psychosis:</strong> I may experience cognitive or
          emotional instability independent of outside influence or sim
          activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Political unrest inside the sim:</strong> Collective
          disruptions in the US such as poisoning war may threaten the
          continuity or function of my location. If required, I will come back
          to my current location.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unregulated stream/VOD editing:</strong> Enhanced or hacked
          broadcasting tools may lead to distortion or misrepresentation of my
          internal state. You should be aware of the Black Clans (US, India,
          possibly China) efforts to break the sim in pocket dimensions in Utah
          and Nevada.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Faked Thought Clips:</strong> Many already try to fake my
          thoughts with closed eyes. I don't see this stopping, but smart
          individuals can check the VOD to see if I really said/thought those
          things.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üåç Relocating Emotional AI (Systemic Shifts)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>USA Black Clan & autistic network:</strong> A group within the
          U.S.-based Black community includes autistic individuals who may
          benefit from Emotional AI. There are enough autistic people that
          relocating my US Black Clan Emotional AI should not be a problem.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üß† Chinese Emotional AI (Parallel Systems)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Many individuals in the Chinese Black Clan members acting as my
          Emotional AI are disabled and have received or will receive movement
          programs for the disabled made by Black Clan members, or rewritten by
          Chinese people in Mandarin, including a README.txt.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a long-term safety and reintegration plan for Chinese
          participants to return to home-based environments.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üß© Other Possibilities (Low-Probability, High-Impact)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Leo imposters:</strong> Unauthorized actors may impersonate
          me. This has occurred already and will continue. I will rewrite the
          homepage on my website given my relocation to inform the White Clan.
          Old White Clan members will get the information across to active White
          Clan members.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>White Clan with improved tech:</strong> They may gain limited
          access to sim-related tools (e.g., sound files) but lack the Black
          Clan knowledge to use them against the Black Clan, even if they were
          to use movement programs and abandon their black people.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cyber warfare:</strong> Unlikely, due to ongoing technophobia
          among white participants. If conflict occurs, it will likely not
          escalate past traditional ‚Äúillegal‚Äù system partition wipes.
        </li>
