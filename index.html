    <h2>Last Update: 6:13 July 17 2025</h2>
    <p>
      I promise I will not do drugs in accordance with Donald Glover's wishes. I
      have stopped vaping. From what I can tell most of the black clan does not
      care about porn, but if I am not relocated I will stop watching by the end
      of the week, assuming that is a concern for you, two way communication
      seems unlikley to impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current long-term plan for the black clan is to slowly make friends
      with me, and mildly torture me, likely increasing their intensity over
      time and if I get an IT job or move to a city. The short-term plan is to
      try to make me psychotic, and to give me incredible anxiety and depression
      if I get a job in IT or move to a metropolitan area. There is no
      kinesthetic data for it, but I was riddled with anxiety while I was in my
      college town, as a result of the black clan.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear what might happen if I am not relocated. For myself and others.

      I have done what I can to get rid of my Emotional AI. They will not all
      leave.
    </p>
    <h3>Additional Risks</h3>
    <p>
      The Black Clan will likely try to infiltrate your implants. They talk
      about paying them off but that will never happen.
    </p>
    <h4>State of the black clan in the US.</h4>
    <p>
      Donald Glover will not mention my name, and has not since the
      inauguration. All policy and actions concerning me by the Black Clan are
      enacted by Donald GloverS (Proxy Binos) and it is not easy for them to
      come to a consensus. People listen to a proxy that tells them what they
      want to hear.
